# This file serves as a template for adding new commands.
# For more inspiration, see already implemented commands.

# Since commands can be invoked by only typing their first letters, please try
# to find a command name that has a unique prefix.

desc 'command ARG [OPTIONAL]', 'one-line description'
long_desc <<-LONGDESC # optional
Start with an example: `command bla bla`

Detailed description with anything the user needs to know.

Short and long description are printed on the console AND included in the README
by `rake update_readme`. Thus, please format descriptions in a way that's reader
friendly both in Markdown and the console. In particular, note that simple line
breaks (\n) will be squished. Only paragraphs (\n\n) will work both on the bash
and in Markdown.
LONGDESC

option :opt, type: :boolean, aliases: '-o', banner: 'VALUE_NAME', desc: 'If set, VALUE_NAME will be used for something'

def example
  # Invoke other commands like this:
  invoke_geordi 'other_command', 'argument', an: 'option'

  Interaction.fail 'Option missing' unless options.opt?

  Interaction.success 'Done.'
end

# Command mappings, usually not needed
map 'beispiel' => 'example'
map '-E' => 'example'
